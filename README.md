### Coding Experience:
Over the summer, I worked on a Khan Academy introductory course to learn some of the fundamentals needed to help with taking this class. Besides that, I don't have much experience, but I'm eager to learn more.
### Reasons for Taking the Class:
Coding has always been something that I've wanted to learn because understanding what goes on behind the scenes in computers can be both very helpful and interesting. I've started introductions to coding throughout my childhood through programs such as code.org, but I've never given myself the chance to truly understand the different languages. I want to take advantage of that opportunity now by taking this class. 
### Other Interests:
Outside of school, soccer takes up most of my extracurricular time; it's something I've had a passion for since the age of 7. In school, my favorite subjects right now include biology and calculus, and I hope to be able to soon add computer science to that list. I also enjoy hobbies such as freshwater fishing and golfing.
### Goals for the Class:
This year, I have two main goals that I want to achieve.
1. I want to further my understanding of the languages we learn like Javascript and Markdown.
1. I'm hoping to be able to apply that knowledge when I need to use it, especially when I'm writing my own code.

Most importantly however, I want my to continue to increase my interest in coding through this course.
### Worries and Fears for the Class:
The thing that I'm trying to be most focused on this year is being able to grasp the the material while staying on track. This is not necessarily a worry, but more something I want to maintain all year, and something I want to put a lot of attention and time towards.
